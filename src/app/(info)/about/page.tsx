                ðŸš€ Why We Created This
              </h2>
              <p className="text-base">
                We noticed that traditional learning methods were either too
                boring or too slow. Students and learners need a platform where
                they can have fun and learn at the same time. ThinkFast was
                created to bring excitement and speed into learning.

              </h2>
              <p className="text-base">
                In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, we often donâ€™t have time for slow
                learning. ThinkFast solves the problem of passive learning by
                making it more interactive and competitive. Itâ€™s not just about
                knowing the right answerâ€”it&apos;s about being the fastest to
                answer!
